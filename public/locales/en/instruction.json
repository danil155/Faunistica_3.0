            "udk_explanation": "What follows is an alphanumeric cipher. Don't worry. This information is important to librarians. The UDC (Universal Decimal Classification) allows you to assign any work to a particular field of knowledge. In the modern world, interest in it is waning, but some countries still use it.",
            "title_explanation": "The title of the work is marked in large font and often in capital letters. From which much can be understood, but not always. Therefore, the section listing the authors is usually followed by an abstract, which very briefly summarises the content of the paper.",

            "introduction_absence": "The ‘Introduction’ section may not be labelled with a title, but in the vast majority of publications it will be present.",
            "materials_methods": "A great deal of important information, including that which we will need to create a record of the finding, is contained in the ‘Material and Methods’ section. This is usually where you will find the method of collection (soil traps, mowing, shaking off vegetation, hand collection, and so on), the specific dates or frequency of counts, the method of calculating indicators for the final presentation of the data, and a description of the study area and the specific habitats where the surveys were conducted. If you are lucky, the ‘Material and Methods’ section hides the geographical coordinates of specific sites and even the dates of the surveys. The layout of this section depends on the type of publication: ecological publications will have more information here, while faunistic publications will have only a small part of it (most of the data for the description of findings are hidden in the main text).",
